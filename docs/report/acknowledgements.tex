\paragraph{} I would like to thank my advisor, M. SÃ©bastien Doeraene, for all the support he provided me with and for the advice he gave me during this semester of work. His help has been very valuable to me and has allowed me to learn many things along the way.

\paragraph{} A huge thank you to my friend Dennis as well, who helped me find inconsistencies in this report by reading through it in time of exams.

\paragraph{} Thank you finally to the EPFL and LAMP for giving me the opportunity to work on this project.
